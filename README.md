# **Cloudflare Abuse Monitor**

[![hacs_badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/HACS-Custom-orange.svg)](https://hacs.xyz)

**Home Assistant: Cloudflare Threat Intelligence Integration**

This is a **custom integration** for Home Assistant and is available via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz) by adding this repository as a custom source.

---

Welcome to **Cloudflare Abuse Monitor**!  
This custom Home Assistant integration allows you to monitor and manage abusive IPs on your **Cloudflare** zone. It integrates:

- üîÑ Real-time traffic analysis
- üõ°Ô∏è IP reputation lookups via AbuseIPDB
- üîÅ Automated updates to your Cloudflare firewall IP lists
- üß† Dynamic recheck logic ‚Äì every 7 days
- üö® Under Attack Mode control ‚Äì based on request thresholds
- ‚è±Ô∏è Smart scheduling ‚Äì runs every custom number of minutes set via scan_interval_minutes


> *Keep your network protected and your automations smart.*

---

## üîç Features

- ‚úÖ **Automatic Blocking**: Block malicious IPs by updating your Cloudflare firewall list.
- üîÑ **Recheck IPs**: Optionally recheck IPs after X days (configurable).
- ‚öôÔ∏è **Custom Modes**: Choose between `Monitor` or `Active` mode for automatic blocking.
- üß† **Smart Skipping**: Avoid rechecking IPs already handled.
- üö® Cloudflare Under Attack Mode support
  
## Sensors
- üìä **Traffic Summary**: Track HTTP requests via Cloudflare GraphQL API.
- üö´ **Skipped IPs**: Track IPs skipped due to existing rules  
- üìã **Listed IPs**: Track IPs currently in your block list  
- ‚ùå **High-Risk IP Detection**: IPs with high AbuseIPDB scores are flagged and handled.
- üõ°Ô∏è Under Attack Mode: Indicates whether Cloudflare's Under Attack Mode is currently enabled (on) or disabled (off) for your zone.

Each sensor updates at a configurable interval (*default: every minute*) and integrates seamlessly with your **Home Assistant dashboard**.

## üÜï What's New in v1.2

### üõ°Ô∏è Under Attack Mode Sensor (NEW!)
- Monitor and **toggle Cloudflare's "Under Attack Mode"** directly from Home Assistant.
- Useful for automating emergency protections when malicious traffic is detected.
- Includes visual state feedback and custom styling for clear alert levels.
- last_request_count tracking in global file ‚Äì Remembers the previous request count to compare with the current value and detect traffic spikes
### ‚è±Ô∏è Smart Scheduling & Next Update Info
- Sensors now expose:
  - `next_update_in`: Countdown (in seconds) until the next update.
  - `next_run_full_format`: Human-readable time of next scheduled run.
- Update intervals can now be **controlled from GUI or config file**:

  `/config/cloudflare_abuse_monitor_configuration.json`

Example:
```json
{
  "scan_interval_minutes": 1,
  "last_request_count": 695
}
```

## üß© Configuration Options

You can now **dynamically adjust** key settings directly from the Home Assistant UI.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Available Options:

| Option                          | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `abuse_confidence_score`        | Minimum AbuseIPDB score to treat an IP as "high risk". Default: `100`      |
| `mode`                          | `Monitor`: Logs only, or `Active`: Automatically blocks high-risk IPs.     |
| `recheck_days`                  | Days to wait before rechecking previously flagged IPs.                     |
| `under_attack_mode`             | Enable or disable Cloudflare Under Attack Mode based on request threshold. |
| `under_attack_request_threshold`| The number of requests per minute is evaluated based on scan_interval_minutes to determine whether to trigger Under Attack Mode.              |
| `scan_interval_minutes`         | How often (in minutes) each sensor should run.                             |

> These options can be changed anytime without restarting Home Assistant.
> These options are accessible under **Configure** in the integration settings:

---

## üí° Example Behavior

If `under_attack_mode` is enabled and `under_attack_request_threshold = 3000`:
- Under Attack Mode is triggered if the number of requests during the scan_interval_minutes period exceeds the defined threshold.

## üìä Cloudflare Abuse Monitor Dashboard

This example **Lovelace dashboard** uses [`button-card`](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card) to show your sensors.
> ‚ÑπÔ∏è **Make sure to update the entity names to match your actual sensor IDs:**

- `sensor.cloudflare_traffic_summary` ‚Üí Replace with your traffic summary sensor  
- `sensor.cloudflare_skipped_ips` ‚Üí Replace with your skipped IPs sensor  
- `sensor.cloudflare_listed_ips` ‚Üí Replace with your listed IPs sensor  
- `sensor.cloudflare_high_risk_ips` ‚Üí Replace with your high-risk IPs sensor
- `sensor.under_attack_mode` ‚Üí Replace with your under_attack_mode sensor
