**Home Assistant: Cloudflare Threat Intelligence Integration**

This is a **custom integration** for Home Assistant and is available via [HACS](https://hacs.xyz) by adding this repository as a custom source.

---

Welcome to **Cloudflare Abuse Monitor**!  
This custom Home Assistant integration allows you to monitor and manage abusive IPs on your **Cloudflare** zone. It integrates:

- 🔄 Real-time traffic analysis  
- 🛡️ IP reputation lookups via **AbuseIPDB**  
- 🔁 Automated updates to your **Cloudflare** firewall IP lists

> *Keep your network protected and your automations smart.*

---

## 🔍 Features

- ✅ **Automatic Blocking**: Block malicious IPs by updating your Cloudflare firewall list.
- 🔄 **Recheck IPs**: Optionally recheck IPs after X days (configurable).
- ⚙️ **Custom Modes**: Choose between `Monitor` or `Active` mode for automatic blocking.
- 🧠 **Smart Skipping**: Avoid rechecking IPs already handled.

## Sensors
- 📊 **Traffic Summary**: Track HTTP requests via Cloudflare GraphQL API.
- 🚫 **Skipped IPs**: Track IPs skipped due to existing rules  
- 📋 **Listed IPs**: Track IPs currently in your block list  
- ❌ **High-Risk IP Detection**: IPs with high AbuseIPDB scores are flagged and handled.

Each sensor updates at a configurable interval (*default: every minute*) and integrates seamlessly with your **Home Assistant dashboard**.

## 📊 Cloudflare Abuse Monitor Dashboard

This example **Lovelace dashboard** uses [`button-card`](https://github.com/custom-cards/button-card) to show your sensors.
> ℹ️ **Make sure to update the entity names to match your actual sensor IDs:**

- `sensor.cloudflare_traffic_summary` → Replace with your traffic summary sensor  
- `sensor.cloudflare_skipped_ips` → Replace with your skipped IPs sensor  
- `sensor.cloudflare_listed_ips` → Replace with your listed IPs sensor  
- `sensor.cloudflare_high_risk_ips` → Replace with your high-risk IPs sensor
